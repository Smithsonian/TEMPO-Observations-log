|Date | Log |
|:-| ----|
| 10/17/2023| **SDPC v4.1** operational processing started (9 hrs)
| 10/18/2023| Frequent data dropouts (missing data), INR might fail and no subsequent data products
|10/19/2023 | **Solar cal Working Diffuser (WD)** <br> Frequent data dropouts (missing data), INR might fail and no subsequent data products
|10/20/2023 | Frequent data dropouts (missing data), INR might fail and no subsequent data products

|10/23/2023| Some data dropout
|10/26/2023| **Solar cal WD** 
|10/29/2023| Bad INR almost all day (**no L2 data products**) (R2.3.8 restart issue), will be reprocessed later with SDPC v4.2.
|10/30/2023| Data dropout, Scan 2 (S002) scan mirror stopped advancing midway through scan (12:21:57Z - 13:01:43Z). Kept imaging of the same location. Scan 2 was still processed. Scan 3 back to normal.
|11/02/2023| **Solar cal WD** <br>
|11/08/2023| bad INR for scans 1-7 (R2.3.8 restart issue). Scans 8-9 are ok, CSM interrupted after s009. L2 data products available for scans 1-9.
|11/09/2023| **Solar cal WD**<br> Intelsat anc_gps dropout 16:50-20:03Z, affecting scans 7-11. Manually restart for scan 12, ok after that. Missing data can be reprocessed. 
|11/16/2023| **Solar cal WD**
|11/18/2023| **SDPC v4.2** operational processing started (INR improvement), boresight correction slightly changes solar observation time, scanning plan was updated with an option to make sure that overpass time within the hour for a particular location is more or less predictable (did not use this option in the science planning).
|11/22/2023|Data Drop out. Scan 6 not at ASDC. INR crashed and then restarted. Major slowdown Internet GS copying starting about 21:30Z. Scans 11,12,13 not at ASDC. Scan 14 and 15 there at ASDC.
|11/23/2023| **Solar cal WD (pre boresight correction)**
|11/24/2023| **Solar cal WD (post boresight correction)**, no obvious difference from 11/23 as BTDF different is taken into account
|11/29/2023| 1 data drop out, inr crashed. Scan 5 not processed, not at ASDC.
|11/30/2023| **Solar cal WD** <br> Scan 3 (S003) scan mirror stopped advancing midway through scan. Kept imaging of the same location. Scan 3 was processed. Scan 4 back to normal.
|12/1/2023| Intelsat encrypted downlink data -- change to GS. Got some corrupted telemetry data starting about 2:13pm EST, apid 150 --scan mechanism telemetry like cma_pos (cal mechanism resolver position) and sma_last_x_pos. Back to normal around 4pm EST. Occurred about 19:13Z to 21:00Z; Scan 9 (18:57:33Z-19:57:14Z) and Scan 10 (19:57:33Z-20:57:14Z), and the beginning of Scan 11 (20:57:33Z-21:37:19Z) may be affected.
